Dataset Description
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 500,000 scholarly articles, including over 200,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.

Accessing the Dataset
This dataset is available on Kaggle. Watch out for periodic updates.

The dataset is also hosted on AI2's Semantic Scholar. And you can search the dataset using AI2's new COVID-19 explorer.

The licenses for each dataset can be found in the all _ sources _ metadata csv file.
